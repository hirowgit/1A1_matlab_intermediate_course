%% Supplementary information to publish
%
% If you want to make a pdf or html file on the code, 
% you can use the code "x_publish_each_codes.m" in the same folder. 
% Please change the file name as " this_file_tag='lec*_step*' "  
% (* will be replaced to the number of the target file). 
%
% The code "x_publish_all_codes.m" works for such a publication applying to all
% codes in the same folder (Note: "x_publish_all_codes_sub.m" should be located in the same folder).
